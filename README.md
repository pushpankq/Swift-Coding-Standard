## Swift Coding Standard

Code structure and organization is a matter of pride for developers. Clear and consistent code signifies clear and consistent thought. Even though the compiler lacks a discerning palate when it comes to naming, whitespace, or documentation, it makes all the difference for human collaborators.

/// Returns the magnitude of a vector in three dimensions
/// from the given components.
///
/// - Parameters:
///     - x: The *x* component of the vector.
///     - y: The *y* component of the vector.
///     - z: The *z* component of the vector.
func magnitude3D(x: Double, y: Double, z: Double) -> Double {
    return sqrt(pow(x, 2) + pow(y, 2) + pow(z, 2))
}
```

### Code blocks

Demonstrate the proper usage or implementation details of a function by embedding code blocks. Inset code blocks by at least four spaces:

```
/**
    The area of the `Shape` instance.

    Computation depends on the shape of the instance.
    For a triangle, `area` is equivalent to:

        let height = triangle.calculateHeight()
        let area = triangle.base * height / 2
*/
var area: CGFloat { get }

```
